<!-- Prototyping -->

### Prototyping

> We designed DevPlanAI using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

### Sample WireFrames

| My Contribution Requests                            | Admin Users screen                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ![Landing](./readme/figma//myRequestsWireFrame.png) | ![fsdaf](./readme/figma/adminUsersWireFrame.png) |

### Sample Mockups

| Dashboard Mockup                               | My Projects Mockup screen                     |

### Tech Stack

#### DevPlanAI is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) for the backend and [React](https://react.dev/) for the FrontEnd. Laravel is a popular open-source PHP web application framework designed for building modern, robust, and scalable web applications.

- For persistent storage (database), the website uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for managing and storing data. It is known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use, and it has become one of the most popular database systems in the world. MySQL is often used in web applications, content management systems (CMS), e-commerce platforms, and many other types of software applications.
- The app uses the font ["Poppins"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.

### Demo

> Using the wireframes and mockups as a guide, we implemented the DevPlanAI app with the following features:

### Performance

> Using Laravel's eloquent models and efficiency in the controller functions here are few performance results directed from postman

#### Performance testing with Postman

| Login function                                                | Register function                                           |

_Start Appache server and MySQL from XAMPP_

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Haidar-02/DevPlanAI.git
   ```

2. Open [phpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) and create a database called `devplanai_db`

3. Open the project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), change the name of the database to devplanai_db at the `server` directory in the `.env` file

   ```js
   DB_DATABASE = devplanai_db;
   ```

4. Right click on the server and run in integrated terminal. Execute the following commands

   ```sh
   composer install

   php artisan migrate

   php artisan jwt:secret
   ```

5. Enter your OpenAI Key in `.env` file

   ```js
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-...";
   ```

6. Start your server by running the following in your terminal
   ```sh
   php artisan serve
